Amanda and Elody have always had a deep love and respect for all creatures great and small. They recognized a need for a dedicated rescue organization in their community and decided to take action. With their generous support, we are able to provide essential medical care, food, and shelter for the animals in our care.

Our team of dedicated volunteers works tirelessly to rescue animals from shelters, the streets, and other situations where they are in need. We provide a safe and nurturing environment for each animal while we work to find them their forever homes. We believe that every animal deserves a second chance and we are committed to making sure they receive the love and care they deserve.

We offer a wide variety of animals for adoption, including dogs, cats, and small animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. All of our animals are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on their vaccinations, and microchipped before they go to their new homes.
